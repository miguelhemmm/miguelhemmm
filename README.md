Hi, Im Miguel Angel Hernandez Melo (Yes, we usually have two names and the second last name is also mandantory in Mexico)

I'm a frontend dev, experienced in javascript and it's frameworks Angular, React and little bit of Vue. Worked with python and flask but it wasn't my thing.
Mostly I'll upload my personal projects or projects related to courses that I'm currently doing. I don't post any job related content, just stuff that I made in my free time.

Here you can find me on
